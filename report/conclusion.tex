We can easily conclude that our results reflect what we know from the theory. Furthermore, it is clear that the proposed locks has quite different performances, also affected by the number of inner iterations and the critical section size. On the other hand, it is not possible to state which lock is the best if we do not know for which kind of application the lock is used for. This because there is a trade-off between the latency (or the total running time) and the fairness.
